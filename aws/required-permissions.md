# Permissions required by the templates

The templates will create a few IAM roles and policies in order to work properly.
Also, the templates will create management roles for Cloud One File Storage Security to manage the deployed resources.
Check out the templates directly for more information.

> **Note:** It's not the permissions required to deploy the templates.
