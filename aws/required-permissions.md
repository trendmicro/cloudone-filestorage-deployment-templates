# User permissions for deployment

Users need to have specific permissions to deploy, update, and delete. The file [deployment-role-policy.json](deployment-role-policy.json) and [deployment-role-policy-for-account-scanner.json](deployment-role-policy-for-account-scanner.json) contain the specific permissions that users need to deploy the CloudFormation templates. We recommend restricting roles to only the permissions required rather than a broad, permissive policy such as `AdministratorAccess`.

To add the policy:

- Go to `AWS account > IAM > Policies > Create policy`.

- Select `JSON` and copy and paste the whole content of the [deployment-role-policy.json](deployment-role-policy.json) file.

- Add `Tags` to the policy (optional), give a `Name` to the policy (Required) and a `Description` (Optional). Your policy is ready to be use.


To attach the policy to the user:

- Go to `IAM > Users` and select the user.
- Click `Add permissions`.
- Select `Attach existing policies directly`.
- Select the policy that you just created and click on `Next > Add permission`.


# Permissions required by the templates

The templates will create the required IAM roles and policies in order to work properly.
Also, the templates will create management roles for Cloud One File Storage Security to manage the deployed resources.
Check out the templates directly for more information.

> **Note:** It's not the permissions required to deploy the templates.
